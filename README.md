# TicTacToe

### Abstract:
This project is the culmination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating a fully functional game that can be played directly in your browser.
It features a 3x3 grid with two players, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) wins the game.
It is designed to be responsive. It creates cute emojis as they are clicked inside the cells.
